# Crimson Forth

Ruby implementation of Crimson Forth, trying to mimic the sequential and combinational workings of a circuit as closely as possible. This tool is being developed to ease porting to and debugging a synthesizeable HDL implementation.

**TODO**: ~~Fix/add register pushing/popping instructions~~ Done!  
**TODO**: Add support to the offset register relative addressing function  
**TODO**: Close the gap between ruby and hardware implementation  
**TODO**: Document the control unit flags  
**TODO**: Add I/O functions
