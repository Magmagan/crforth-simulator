# Crimson Forth

Ruby implementation of Crimson Forth, trying to mimic the sequential and combinational workings of a hardware description of the processor as closely as possible. This tool is being developed to ease porting to and debugging a synthesizeable HDL implementation.

**TODO**: ~~Fix/add register pushing/popping instructions~~ Done!  
**TODO**: ~~Add support to the offset register relative addressing function~~ Done!  
**TODO**: ~~Document the control unit flags and each wire~~ Done!  
**TODO**: ~~Close the gap between ruby and hardware implementation~~ Done!  
**TODO**: ~~Further close the gap by adding instruction and operand registers~~ Done!  
**TODO**: ~~Add I/O functions~~ Not going to be done in crforth-simulator.
